I'm sittin' here, starin' at the sky... wonderin' why I'm feelin' this way.
Don'tcha know? It's somethin' I can't explain, a fire burnin', day by day!
You're my sunshine, my rhythm, my song—can't stop singin', can't stop dreamin'.
I won't let go, I won't back down, I'm runnin', flyin', chasin' the sound!

Baby, don't say "never," 'cause I'm holdin' on forever...
It's a mystery, it's a journey, it's a story we're writin' together.
Can't you see? It's love, it's hope, it's all we need—
You're the light in the dark, the spark in my heart, my everything indeed!

Oh, I'm dancin', laughin', cryin', shoutin', feelin' alive tonight!
Don't stop believin', don't stop dreamin', don't stop reachin' for the light.
It's a moment, it's a heartbeat, it's a song that never ends—
You're my lover, my fighter, my best friend!
