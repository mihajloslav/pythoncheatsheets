I can't believe it's real, the way I'm feelin', the way I'm dreamin'...
Don't you see? It's a chance, it's a dance, it's a moment we can't lose!
I'm runnin' fast, I'm flyin' high—nothin' can stop me now.
You're the beat in my heart, the sound in my soul, the reason I sing out loud!

Oh, don't let go, don't fade away, I'm holdin' on with all my might.
It's a story we're tellin', a song we're yellin', a spark in the darkest night.
You're my fire, my desire, my hope, my flame—
And I can't stop callin' your name, callin' your name, callin' your name!

Baby, I'm laughin', cryin', runnin', shoutin', all at once, tonight!
It's a feelin' I can't hide, a truth I can't fight.
Don't say "never," don't say "maybe," just say you'll stay—
'Cause I'm here forever, and I won't walk away!
